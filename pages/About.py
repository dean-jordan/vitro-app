st.text("Vitro is a tool for creating DNA prefixes. DNA prefixes are extremely useful in a variety of fields, including synthetic biology and chemistry, as they are the input for machine learning models such as Evo 2. These models can generate entire genomes from these prefixes, hence allowing for synthetic life to be generated. By creating more complex prefixes, more complex life can be synthetically generated. Hence, Vitro exists as a tool to create complex life through prefix development.")
